# data readme

The simulated data from `Collection 1` (see Section 4 of [1]) is included as
`collection-1.zip`, which needs to be extracted. This data was obtained by
running the SDL method (30 times, for each of 5 distinct sets of polynomial
constraints) to test the tree topology of a four-leaf phylogenetic tree using
randomly-generated sequence data from the CFN model.

The `Collection 1` data is divided into five subfolders corresponding to the
five sets of generating polynomials considered in the paper (CDD, PDR, PDM,
CDR, CDM). These subfolders are further subdivided on the basis of the number
of convex combination constraints used. In each, you will find
`parameters.txt` files, which record all parameter information about the run.
(These files are duplicated since the `Collection 1` dataset was generated
across multiple runs, with a new `parameters.txt` file generated automatically
each time.)
