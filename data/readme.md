# data readme

Included in this folder is the treespace dataset used in the CFN section of
our paper. It was obtained by running the SDL method (30 times, for each of 5
distinct sets of polynomial constraints) to test the tree topology of a
four-leaf phylogenetic tree using randomly-generated sequence data from the
CFN model.

The parameters.txt files are duplicated since this dataset was generated
across multiple runs, with a parameters.txt file generated automatically each
time.

The folder names are based on the original names of the 5 generating polynomials.

TODO: change the names of the folders, merge the parameters.txt files.
