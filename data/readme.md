## collection 1

Included the folder `collection-1/` is the treespace dataset `Collection 1`
used in the CFN section of our paper. It was obtained by running the SDL
method (30 times, for each of 5 distinct sets of polynomial constraints) to
test the tree topology of a four-leaf phylogenetic tree using
randomly-generated sequence data from the CFN model. This dataset is included
in the gitrepo because it took many hours to simulate.

The `Collection 1` data is divided into five subfolders, based on the 5 sets
of generating polynomials considered in the paper (CDD, PDR, PDM, CDR, CDM).
These subfolders are further subdivided on the basis of the number of convex
combination constraints used. In each, you will find `parameters.txt` files,
which record all parameter information about the run. These files are
duplicated since the `Collection 1` dataset was generated across multiple
runs, with a new `parameters.txt` file generated automatically each time.
